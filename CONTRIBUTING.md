# Contributing to Awesome FDE Roadmap

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This list exists to help engineers move into high-stakes, client-facing Forward Deployed Engineering roles — every addition should serve that mission.

Read this file, then check that your proposed change clears the quality bar below. Low-effort PRs that duplicate existing entries or add tangentially-relevant links will be closed.

## What counts as a good contribution

**Yes:**
- A resource (book, course, whitepaper, docs, blog, podcast, tool) that materially helped you or someone you know move into an FDE-shaped role.
- A war story translated into a general lesson — a new entry in Case Studies, Red Flags, or the Discovery Checklist.
- A correction: outdated product naming, dead link, wrong date, technical inaccuracy, awkward phrasing.
- A new pattern or framework that closes a real gap in the current roadmap (e.g., a section on X that the README doesn't cover today).

**No:**
- Vendor pitches, marketing pages, or self-promotion of a course/book you're selling — unless disclosed *and* genuinely essential to the roadmap.
- Duplicates — search the README first.
- Additions to the "Canon" reading list that dilute the shortlist. The Canon is deliberately tight.
- LLM-generated content without human review and personal endorsement.
- Blockchain / Web3 / crypto content.

## Quality bar for each entry

Each new link should:

1. **Be free, or clearly worth the cost.** Note paid resources explicitly.
2. **Have a one-sentence description explaining *why it matters for FDEs*** — not just what the resource is.
3. **Be currently maintained.** Books are fine; abandoned SaaS tools are not.
4. **Point to a live URL that returns HTTP 200.** Check before submitting.

## Formatting rules

Match the existing style:

- Link entries: `*   **[Name](url):** One-sentence description of why an FDE should read/watch/use it.`
- Google Cloud product names: use the current name with the older name in parentheses on first mention (e.g., `Agent Runtime (formerly Vertex AI Agent Engine)`). See the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform section of the README for canonical current naming.
- Section headings match the existing emoji-then-title pattern (`### 🚀 Section Title`).
- No emoji in code, only in headings and section markers.
- Use American English spelling for consistency.

## PR checklist

Before hitting submit:

- [ ] I've read this file.
- [ ] My entry isn't already in the README.
- [ ] I've added a one-sentence "why it matters for FDEs" description.
- [ ] I've checked all my links return HTTP 200.
- [ ] My entry sits in the correct section (Data Engineering / Cloud / Consulting / Applied AI / Air-Gap / Interview / Reading List / Glossary).
- [ ] The PR is focused on one theme (don't bundle a book, a fix, and a new section together).
- [ ] I've written a PR description explaining *why* this addition strengthens the roadmap.

## PR process

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch: `git checkout -b add-<short-name>`.
2. Make your change. If it's a substantive addition (not just a link), spell out your reasoning in the PR description.
3. Open the PR against `main`.
4. Expect feedback. A maintainer may ask you to revise phrasing, move the entry, or split a large PR.
5. Not every PR gets merged. The list stays strong by staying selective — please don't take a decline personally.

## Reporting issues without a PR

If you've spotted an error but don't have time to fix it, open an issue with:

- The file, section, and line number (or a link to the rendered heading).
- What's wrong and what it should say.
- A source, if you have one.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful. Assume good faith. Don't post links or descriptions that would embarrass a professional client (real war stories should be anonymized). Harassment or personal attacks will result in the PR being closed and the contributor being blocked.

## Attribution

By opening a PR, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the repo's [MIT License](LICENSE) and that you have the right to submit it.
